            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>We roast coffee ethically sourced from farms all over the world. We emphasize sourcing high quality beans from farms that care as much as 
              we do about the product. We want everyone involved, from the farmer, to you, to be able to have the best experience possible with our products.</p>

          <div class="why">
            <h2>Why We Do It</h2>
            <p>We believe that coffee is best enjoyed when you know it has been grown and processed by people who care, and that you know the money you are spending 
              is going directly to better the lives and communities of those farms.

                  Not sure where to start? Check out our medium roast offerings. These coffees are not as wild as our light roasts, but not as heavy as our dark roasts.
                  Many of our offerings here serve as exceptionally tasty compromises between the extremes. Think standard coffee flavors, but with hints of flavor that 
                  can be found in our other roasts.

                  Our specialty light roasts provide unique and innovative takes on traditional production methods that result in exciting, different coffees that push the .
                  boundaries of what coffee tastes like. Expect to find unique, floral, frutiy and weird notes in these offerings. Weird is wonderful!

                  Cold winter days, campfires, log cabins, the great outdoors, etc. These are the images conjured up when enjoying one of our dark roasts. Bold, strong flavors 
                  with notes of smoke, caramel, earth and wood. We pride ourselves on producing great dark roasts that are full flavored without that char 
                  or burnt flavor you might associate with dark roasts.
