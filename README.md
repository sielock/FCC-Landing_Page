This is my code for the FreeCodeCamp project: Product Landing Page. 

The goal was to recreate a page that met these user story requirements: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page

I am building this just using HTML5 and CSS3. Nothing fancy, just practicing the fundamentals. Specifically focusing on the use of CSS grid and flexbox layout techniques. There is a sparce amount of JavaScript, but it is only used to render the navigation bar for smaller viewports.

The site is being hosted on Github pages, and it can be seen live at: https://sielock.github.io/FCC-Landing_Page
