This is my code for the FreeCodeCamp project: Product Landing Page. 

The goal was to recreate a page that met these user story requirements: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page

I am building this just using HTML5 and CSS3. Nothing fancy, just practicing the fundamentals. Specifically focusing on refreshing my knowledge of the CSS grid and flexbox layout techniques.

The site is being hosted on Github pages, and it can be seen live at: https://sielock.github.io/FCC-Landing_Page

Currently, only the HTML skeleton is up so it looks pretty rough. Styling is up next though, and that should rectify that issue!
