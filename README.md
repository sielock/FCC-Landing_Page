This is my code for the FreeCodeCamp project: Product Landing Page. 

The goal was to recreate a page that met these user story requirements: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page

I am building this just using HTML5 and CSS3. Nothing fancy, just practicing the fundamentals. Specifically focusing on the use of CSS grid and flexbox layout techniques. There is a sparse amount of JavaScript, but it is only used to render the navigation bar.

I have come back to this project to better impelement responsive design, as well as update the design in general. One new addition is the use of a smart nav, courtesy of CSS Tricks (https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-smart-navbar-with-vanilla-javascript/), which causes the navbar to disappear when scrolling down, and reappear when scrolling up.

The site is being hosted on Github pages, and it can be seen live at: https://sielock.github.io/FCC-Landing_Page
